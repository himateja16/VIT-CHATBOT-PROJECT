This project focuses on solving a common problem faced by many students at VIT, where they struggle to quickly find information related to attendance rules, timetables, leave application procedures, and basic administrative details. Students usually have to search across multiple platforms like VTOP, the university website, or contact faculty, which takes unnecessary time. To make this easier, the aim of the project is to create a simple Java-based console chatbot that can instantly answer frequently asked questions. The chatbot uses a small internal FAQ database where each question is linked to a prepared answer, and it checks the student’s query to find the closest match. The scope of this project includes creating a chatbot module that takes questions from the user, a database module that stores all FAQs, and an admin module that allows new FAQ entries to be added. This system is designed for VIT students, faculty, and especially new students who need quick information without browsing multiple sources. Overall, the project provides a simple, user-friendly, and fast method to access basic academic and administrative information through a Java console application.
